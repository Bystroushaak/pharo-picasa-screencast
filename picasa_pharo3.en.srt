00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,180
This video shows

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,180
how to get pictures from Picasa

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
though its REST API and XML feed.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,140
Then how to build both a desktop application

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
and a web page served by Pharo itself

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,290
to display them.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,390
The main (World) menu is opened

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,390
by clicking on the background.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,290
For more readability

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,390
I increase the font size

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,390
through the Settings Browser.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Picasa provides a RESTful API

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
through which we can search for photos

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
and get the result as a XML document.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,680
Just copy the provided URL

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
and paste it into a Pharo workspace.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,670
A workspace is used to dynamically evaluate some Smalltalk code.

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,270
Let's search for five photos of lighthouses.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,550
ZnClient allows to build, execute and process HTTP requests

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,860
The XML feed is successfully retrieved

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,750
but it's not easy to examine it as a raw string.

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,750
Pharo doesn't come with a XML parser,

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,810
but we can install one easily thanks to the Configuration Browser.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,910
Configuration Browser allows to install Metacello configurations,

25
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,910
which describe groups of packages and their dependencies

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,910
for each version of Pharo.

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,650
Once done, the XMLDOMParser class is loaded into Pharo

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,750
and we can use it to parse the XML feed.

29
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,946
Pharo comes with awesome debugging tools.

30
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,046
Using the Explorer, we can browse the entire object graph

31
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:26,883
which makes it easy to inspect the hierarchy of XML nodes !

32
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:28,883
Each photo is described in an <i>entry</i> tag

33
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:32,983
wich itself contains a self-explaining <i>title</i> tag

34
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,083
and the URL in the <i>src</i> attribute of a <i>content</i> tag

35
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:43,941
From the inspector you can access the class of every object

36
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,041
using the <i>Browse Class</i> menu entry.

37
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,496
The default class browser is named <i>Nautilus</i>.

38
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:53,496
It offers a large range of tools to browse and modify classes.

39
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:58,596
We can dynamically evaluate some Smalltalk code

40
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,696
in the context of the explorer.

41
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,645
From the root node of the XML document

42
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,745
we can retrieve all children nodes

43
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:06,845
that are named <i>entry</i>.
